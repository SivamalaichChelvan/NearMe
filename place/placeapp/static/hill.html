    <p>The Annamalaiyar Hills, also known as the sacred Arunachala Hill, rise majestically over the ancient town of Tiruvannamalai, creating a landscape where spirituality and nature blend seamlessly. Revered as the embodiment of Lord Shiva in the form of fire, the hill has drawn saints, seekers, and pilgrims for centuries. Its rocky slopes glow under the sun, giving it an aura that feels both timeless and powerful. At the foothills stands the grand Annamalaiyar Temple, one of South India’s most iconic Shiva temples, anchoring the spiritual energy of the region. Devotees from across the world come to perform Girivalam, the 14‑kilometer circumambulation around the hill, especially during full moon nights when the atmosphere becomes electric with devotion. The annual Karthigai Deepam festival transforms the hill into a beacon of divine light as a massive flame is lit at its peak. The hill is also home to serene meditation spots like Skandashramam and Virupaksha Cave, where Sri Ramana Maharshi spent years in deep contemplation. The paths leading up the hill offer breathtaking views of the town and the surrounding plains. Early mornings bring a soft mist that wraps the hill in a mystical veil, while evenings paint it in warm golden hues. Many believe that simply being near Arunachala brings peace, clarity, and inner transformation. Its ancient rocks, said to be among the oldest geological formations on Earth, hold stories of sages and seekers who found enlightenment in its presence. Whether one visits for devotion, meditation, or the sheer beauty of nature, the Annamalaiyar Hills leave an imprint that lingers long after the journey ends.</p>
